## Hi there 👋, my name is Margaret Hilliard 

I'm a computational biologist doing interdisciplinary microbiome and nutrition research. 💻 🧬 🍔

👯 Currently collaborating with the Western Human Nutrition Research Center on applying machine learning + taxonomically-aware algorithms to predict plasma B12 from fecal metagenome and diet data.

🌱 Learning Snakemake for reproducible bioinformatics workflows and Docker for shareable R-based analyses.
